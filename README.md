# Image_Recognition_ML
This is an Image Recognition model created from scratch using mathematical concepts (linear algebra and differentiation) and the libraries Scipy and Numpy. The images of different clothing garments are used as the data here. Based on that data, the model predicts the name of the garment whose image is fed to the code.
